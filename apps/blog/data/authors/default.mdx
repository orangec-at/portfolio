Jaeil Lee has been passionate about creating 0-1 products since beginning his career with JavaScript in 2020. He has explored various technologies including Java, Python, TypeScript, Linux, Docker, and PostgreSQL while participating in numerous projects. Through self-taught professional development, he has built expertise across a wide range of domains from full-stack development to system maintenance, monitoring, and performance optimization.

Since 2024, he has been challenging himself with product development using TypeScript monorepo full-stack development. His hobbies include running, yoga, and meditation, while his interests revolve around beautiful illustrations, creating compelling characters and worldbuilding, and gamification. Recently, he has been working to develop his design sensibilities by learning design through design school and interacting with designers.

His goal is to share insights about the deep development environment discovered through fixing errors and bugs encountered during full-stack product development, analyze and redesign reference app UX/UI, share beautiful illustrations, and research gamification, storytelling, characters, and Universe.

If you're interested in product creation infused with personal taste, you might feel you've found a fellow traveler navigating this magnificent universe.
